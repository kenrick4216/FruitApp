be viewed. On each measurement, clicking on the dropdown menu will reveal more information about the
measurement.

specific measurement from memory. Clicking on `Clear All History` button will delete all past entries.

# Code Reuse Declaration
Most of the code used in this project were adapted from the [Android Basics with Compose](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-compose/course)
course. This project was built in parallel with Units 1 through 6 of the course.

Gemini was also used to debug the project occasionally, especially when plugins and dependencies
were conflicting.
